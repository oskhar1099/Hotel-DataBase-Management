        <h1>API Documentation</h1>
        <p>Here we're going to explain our design, the collections used and the routes 
            the user has to follow to complete all the funcionalities. <br><br>

            It's recommended using Postman for posting, updating and deleting requests. For getting requests
            any explorer with a JSON viewer can show the information in a good way.
        </p>
        <div id="collections-column">
            <h2>Collections</h2>
            <p>For resolving all the funcionalities we use 4 collections, that are:
                <ol>
                    <li value="1">hotels</li>                            
                    <li>users</li>                            
                    <li>companies</li>
                    <li>bookings</li>
                </ol>                    
                Is important to say that the collections names are in lower case because of the mongoose specifications.
                It takes the collection name, put it into lower case and put an 's' at the end. <br><br>

                 Now, we are going to explain every route in each collection. All the collections need server.js to get started in the terminal
                 by typing node server.js. They all are listening on port 3000.
            </p>
            <h3>hotels</h3>
            <p>
                The hotels collection has the following routes:
                <ul>
                    <li>app.get('/Hotel', hotel.findAll)
                        <p>For searching hotels by severial criteria (Funcionality #1).<br><br>
                            It's called in http://localhost:3000/Hotel/ and following the '/', the user has to put '?', then
                            the variable name followed by an '=' and then the value the user want. In case of searching
                            by several criteria the user has to use the corrects operators for example: 
                            http://localhost:3000/Hotel/?State=KERALA&Size=Large retrieve every hotel
                            that its State is KERALA and its Size is Large. <br>
                            The variables names in the URL have to be identical that the ones in the collection schema
                            for a correct searching.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li> app.get('/Hotel/:latitude/:longitude/:range', hotel.findAll)
                            <p>For searching hotels by latitude, longitude and a range (Funcionality #2).<br><br>
                                It's called in http://localhost:3000/Hotel/ and following the '/' the user has to put the 
                                latitude, longitude and the range separated by '/'. And using the Haversine Distance equation,
                                its retrieve all the hotels in the given range (kms). For example: <br>
                                http://localhost:3000/Hotel/20/70/50 will return every hotel in a radial range
                                of 50km from the coordenades 20, 70 latitude an longitude respectively.
                            </p>
